We improved our laser modem circuit and mechanical system during a residency at [FACTLab](http://fact.alab.space/){:target="_blank"} throughout 2015.

## Transmitter
The circuit for the transmitter has stayed pretty much the same throughout the different prototypes: an n-channel MOSFET transistor is used to modulate the laser, based on the UART Tx signal from the microcontroller. For more powerful lasers, we used a [5A constant current driver](http://www.ebay.com/itm/201010032225){:target="blank_"} between the mosfet and the laser.

      </a>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>

## Receiver
It's always harder to receive a signal than it is to transmit one, so our receiver circuit has had many different versions. A receiver built from MOSFETs alone wasn't stable enough, and the receivers we initially built for [Acciones Territoriales]({{ site.baseurl }}/post/exteresa/) and [Labic]({{ site.baseurl }}/post/labic/) used an [LM-358 op-amp](http://www.ti.com/product/LM358){:target="_blank"} to amplify a signal captured by either a photodiode or a phototransistor. These worked well, but the [LM-358](http://www.ti.com/product/LM358){:target="_blank"} doesn't have a bandwidth wide enough to deal with signals at more than 30KHz with a voltage supply of 5V, so we started experimenting with high-speed op-amps like the [LT-1226](http://www.linear.com/product/LT1226){:target="_blank"} and [LT-1259](http://www.linear.com/product/LT1259){:target="_blank"}. A few different configurations were considered, but in the end we used the [LT-1226](http://www.linear.com/product/LT1226){:target="_blank"} with a [2N2222 NPN transistor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2N2222){:target="_blank"} pre-amplifier.

      </a>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}

## Pan/Tilt Mechanism
In order to facilitate the alignment between lasers and receivers we created a simple pan/tilt mechanism using [worm gears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worm_drive){:target="_blank"} and 3D-printed parts. We also started using multiple photodiodes and a small piece of translucent plastic on each receiver to diffuse the laser and avoid having to aim at a single photodiode.
