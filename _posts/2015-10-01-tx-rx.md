We improved our laser modem circuit and mechanical system during a residency at [FACTLab](http://fact.alab.space/){:target="_blank"} throughout 2015.

## Tx
The circuit for the transmitter has stayed pretty much the same throughout the different prototypes. A n-channel MOSFET transistor is used to modulate the UART Tx signal from the microcontroller.
