We used our time at the 2014 [*Inovación Ciudadana* Laboratory](http://www.ciudadania20.org/labicmx/){:target="_blank"} in Veracruz, México to further experiment with the laser modem system and its interface.

In addition to using the laser modem to transmit text messages via chat, we also created a separate interface to share files between the two modems. This system used a simple web interface to upload files and messages to a database synced between the two modems. This interface could only be accesed through a local WiFi network created by each of the modems. The idea was to create a model where local, short-range networks could share documents over larger distances with other local networks.

Also, many thanks to: Anna, Cinthia, Diego, Johann and Mariel, who helped as our collaborators and were invaluable in the technical and conceptual development of the project.
