In the first story, a brazilian astronaut arrives at a deserted planet and quickly claims it for his country, at the same time as another astronaut claims the other side of the same planet for some unkown country/species. Why is there a brazilian astronaut claiming planets with a flag? When did this imagery become so commonplace that it's immediately recognized by children as something that astronauts must obviously do?

The second story shows how technology is used in the construction of the imaginary (television, telescope), and the dissonances caused by following these borrowed narratives.
