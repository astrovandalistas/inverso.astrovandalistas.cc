We spent October of 2015 in El Paso, Texas, preparing for the exhibition *Territory of the Imagination: At the Border of Art and Space*. The exhibiton took place around the US-Mexico border region in El Paso, Texas and Juarez, Mexico. Through a series of exhibitions, workshops and public events, [Territory of the Imagination](http://rubin.utep.edu/index.php/past1/68){:target="_blank"}:

<div class="quotes">&quot;looked at the work of artists who engage in disruptive, alternative, and collective interactions with space and space technology&quot;.</div>

During our month in El Paso we investigated the possibility of creating a network of transborder laser modems. This network would be created on both sides of the border and use our laser modems to share documents and create a communication channel across the border and across other large distances. 

<div class="swipebox-gallery">
  {% for file in site.static_files %}
    {% if file.path contains "map_" %}
      <a href="{{ file.path }}" class="swipebox map-gallery">
        <img src="{{ file.path }}" alt="">
      </a>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
</div>

This proved to be harder than we thought. Besides the expected technical and judicial challenges, we also faced difficulty in finding people or groups that were insterested in building, maintaining or using this network with us. During a series of workshops on both sides of the border, we noticed that people were more worried about communicating with the future, than with the other side of the border. Nonetheless, we set up a small laser network between two points within the Rubin Center gallery and a nearby cave.
